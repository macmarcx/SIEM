# SIEM Dashboard 

This repository contains the code and instructions for the **SIEM Monitoring Dashboard** (Security Information and Event Management), designed to help visualize and analyze security data, such as events and logs collected from various sources across an IT infrastructure.

## Overview

The **SIEM Dashboard** aims to provide an intuitive and accessible graphical interface for security teams to monitor, detect, and respond to threats more efficiently. The dashboard integrates data from multiple sources, allowing event correlation and providing real-time insights into network security status.

### Key Features:
- **Real-time monitoring**: Track security logs and events as they happen.
- **Log analysis**: Filters and drill-down options for detailed event analysis.
- **Threat detection**: Automated alerts based on custom correlation rules.
- **Interactive visualizations**: Charts, tables, and maps for easier data interpretation.
- **SIEM integration**: Integrates with popular SIEM tools like Splunk, Elastic, QRadar, among others.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following tools installed in your environment:

- Node.js v14+ (for running the dashboard frontend)
- Your chosen SIEM tool (Splunk, Elastic, etc.)
- Access to security logs and events that will be monitored

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/macmarcx/SIEM.git
   cd SIEM
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   npm run dev
   ```

The dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Configuration

In the `config.js` file, you can customize the following options:

- **SIEM connection**: Define the endpoints to connect your SIEM tool.
- **Correlation rules**: Set up rules for threat detection and alert generation.
- **Filters and visualizations**: Adjust parameters to display specific logs and custom charts.
